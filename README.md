## The ultimate ruby interview booster

Use this to speed up your small interview tasks
by quickly setting up guard and test:unit
to test your interview problems.

You can use this in contrast to traditional stdin/stdout
testing.

## Usage

  $> bundle install
  $> bundle exec guard

Then edit example.rb and test/example_test.rb and
create your solution/tests respectively.
